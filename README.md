Use javascript

Note: To check live, a good maneer could be to use the Youtube API search to check the broadcast status,
except it reach the quota fast after a 100 search per day, so the chrome extension stick with the fetching 
method for now.

Note : this project is following chrome extension guidelines :
- to produce chrome extension
